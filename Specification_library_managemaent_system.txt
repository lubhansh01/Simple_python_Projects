Task 1: Create a Library Management System
Objective: Implement a simple library management system with classes for books and members.

Steps:

Define a Book Class:

Attributes: title, author, isbn, availability
Methods: borrow_book(), return_book(), display_info()
Define a Member Class:

Attributes: name, member_id, borrowed_books (list)
Methods: borrow_book(book), return_book(book), display_borrowed_books()
Implement Book Borrowing:

In the Member class, implement the borrow_book() method to check the availability of the book and add it to the member's borrowed_books list if available.
Implement Book Returning:

In the Member class, implement the return_book() method to remove the book from the borrowed_books list and update the book's availability.
Test the System:

Create instances of Book and Member.
Simulate borrowing and returning books, and display the information of books and members.
