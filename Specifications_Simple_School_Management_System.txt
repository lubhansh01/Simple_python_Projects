Develop a School Management System
Objective: Implement a basic school management system with classes for students and courses.

Steps:

Define a Student Class:

Attributes: name, student_id, enrolled_courses (list)
Methods: enroll(course), drop(course), display_courses()
Define a Course Class:

Attributes: course_name, course_code, max_students, enrolled_students (list)
Methods: add_student(student), remove_student(student), display_info()
Implement Enrollment and Dropping:

In the Student class, implement the enroll() and drop() methods to manage the courses a student is enrolled in.
In the Course class, implement the add_student() and remove_student() methods to manage the students enrolled in the course.
Ensure Maximum Capacity:

Ensure that the add_student() method in the Course class does not allow more students to be added than the maximum capacity.
Test the System:

Create instances of Student and Course.
Simulate enrolling and dropping courses, and display the information of students and courses
